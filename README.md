# Bookmark
 One of my school projets (restapi)
 
 What I learned while I make this project
 - How is working a restapi
 - How to use authentication
 - How to use and build GET, POST, PUT methods
 
 How to test the application
 - Download or clone the project
 - From PHP folder copy all files to your www folder (wamp64) and open it in your browser
 - Open MyPhpAdmin and create database with "bookmark_rest" name
 - In your database create a table with "bookmark" name
 - From SQL/restapi.sql copy all the lines into the table sql and run
 - And finally in the program Form1.cs URL string value is need to be your link from the browser
